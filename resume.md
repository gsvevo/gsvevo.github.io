## Summary

I'm a Master's student in the department of Geography at Oregon State University. My background is in Classical Archaeology and Latin Epigraphy. In the last few years I specialized in the application of technology and computer programs to field and landscape archeology.  I use photogrammetry (Structure from Motion), GPS/GNSS measurements and GIS applications to produce extremely detailed and precise documentation of archeological activities, from intra-site (a single layer of an excavation) to inter-site level (complex archaeological/topographical map of a region).
